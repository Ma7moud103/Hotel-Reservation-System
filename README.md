Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface.
TypeScript: For static type checking.
Redux: Used for managing authentication and app state.
React Query: Used for efficient data fetching, prefetching, and caching.
Supabase: Used for handling authentication and interacting with the backend database.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
clsx, tailwind-merge: Used for handling conditional class names and merging Tailwind classes.
Note: Redux and React Query were both used to explore my skills, but in hindsight, one of them could be sufficient for handling both data fetching and state management. I found that using only one of them would simplify the code and improve maintainability.
